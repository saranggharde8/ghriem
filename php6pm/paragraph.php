		Silent speech interface systems have been created using 
		ultrasound and optical camera input of tongue and lip 
		movements. Electromagnetic devices are another technique
		for tracking tongue and lip movements. The detection of
		speech movements by electromyography of speech articulator
		muscles and the larynx is another technique. Another
		source of information is the vocal tract resonance signals
		that get transmitted through bone conduction called non-audible
		murmurs. They have also been created as a brainâ€“computer 
		interface using brain activity in the motor cortex obtained
		from intracortical microelectrodes.
